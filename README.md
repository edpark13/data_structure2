Binary search tree
Bst able to insert a new node. If the new value is greater it will be inserted
to the right if less it will be inserted in the left duplicates will be
ignored. Contains method will return if a value is in the Binary search tree.
Size method will return the number of values stored in the tree. Depth will
return number of levels the tree has. Balance will return the number how
many levels the right has more than the left.

Binary Search Tree: Transverse Strategies
Updated Bst to include four methods of transversal. One breadth first and
three depth first. The depth first methods are as follows: pre-order
post-order and in-order.

Hash Table
Created a simple hash table which stores key and value pairs as a
list of lists. The hashing method is a simple summation of values
for input into a list. The hashing method is a sub module of the class
and can be easily replaced with a more prefect method at a later time.

Insertion Sort
Given a list calling the insertion function will return the list but sorted
from least to max. The main function will test the fastest case with is an
pre ordered list but the slowest case where the list is ordered from max to
least. When increasing from 100 to 1000 items the fastest case slowed 10 times
because the number of items increased by 10 times and the slowest case
increase by 100 times or 10^2.

Merge Sort
Sorts a list of values in order from least to greates. The sort method
preserves stability. Method works on empty lists. For more information on
merge sort refer to the following:
